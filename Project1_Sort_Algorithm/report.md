## Selection Sort
The main idea of selection sort that we have two array, one is sorted and the other is unsorted. We pick up the smallest element from the unsorted array and add it to the end of the sorted array. 
The time complexity of selection sort is $O(n^2)$

## Insertion Sort
The idea behind insertion sort is similar to selection sort. The difference is that in insertion sort, we pick the next element from the unsorted list instead of the smallest. Then we insert this element into the sorted array at the correct order(by assending order). The time complexity of selection sort is $O(n^2)$

## Quick Sort
Quick sort use the devide and conquer philosophy. First we need to choose one element as pivot. Then partition the array into two parts. On the left is everything smaller than pivot, on the right is everything bigger than pivot. After each partition, we will recursively call the partition process.
