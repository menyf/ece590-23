There are still several things to be written in the report, but I have no idea how to do these:

[ ] Why do we report theoretical runtimes for asymptotically large values of n?
[ ] What happens to the runtime for smaller values of n? Why do you think this is?
[ ] What happens if you time your code while performing a computationally expensive task in the background (i.e., opening an internet browser during execution)?
[ ] Why do we analyze theoretical runtimes for algorithms instead of implementing them and reporting actual/experimental runtimes? Are their times when theoretical runtimes provide more useful comparisons? Are their times when experimental runtimes provide more useful comparisons?
